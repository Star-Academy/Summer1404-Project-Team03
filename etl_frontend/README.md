# 🚀 ETL Frontend

This project is an **Angular frontend application** that can be run in two modes:

- **Development mode** → Live reload with Angular CLI (`ng serve`)
- **Production mode** → Built Angular app served with **nginx**

---

## 📦 Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (20+ recommended)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (optional, for using the provided shortcuts)

## ⚡️ Quick Commands (Makefile)

A `Makefile` is included to simplify the Docker commands.

### Development

- **Start development server:**
  ```bash
  make dev
  ```
- **Build & start development server:**
  ```bash
  make dev-build
  ```
- **Stop development server:**
  ```bash
  make dev-down
  ```

### Production

- **Start production server:**
  ```bash
  make prod
  ```
- **Build & start production server:**
  ```bash
  make prod-build
  ```
- **Stop production server:**
  ```bash
  make prod-down
  ```

---

## 🔧 Development Mode (Hot Reload)

This mode runs Angular with live reload (`ng serve`) inside a Docker container. Any local code changes will automatically trigger a rebuild inside the container.

- **To run (using Makefile):**
  ```bash
  make dev-build
  ```
- **To run (manual command):**
  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
  ```

The app will be available at: **http://localhost:4200**

✅ **Dev Notes:**
Make sure `package.json` includes the following script to allow connections from outside the container:

````json
"scripts": {
  "start": "ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --poll 2000"
}

## 🚀 Production Mode (nginx)

This mode builds a static Angular production bundle and serves it using an efficient `nginx` web server.

-   **To run (using Makefile):**
    ```bash
    make prod-build
    ```
-   **To run (manual command):**
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```

The app will be available at: **http://localhost**

✅ **Nginx Notes:**
The `nginx.conf` file is configured to handle single-page application (SPA) routing by redirecting all non-file requests back to `index.html`.

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;

  root /usr/share/nginx/html;
  index index.html;

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
  }
}
🧹 Cleanup
To stop and remove the containers for a specific environment, use the down commands.

Stop the development environment:

Bash

make dev-down
Stop the production environment:

Bash

make prod-down
````
